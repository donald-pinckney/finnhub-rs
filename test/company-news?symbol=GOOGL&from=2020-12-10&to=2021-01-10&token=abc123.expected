        summary: "LONDON (AP) — Britain\'s competition watchdog said Friday it launched an investigation into Google\'s plan to overhaul its ad data system over worries it could leave even less room for rivals in the online ad industry. The Competition and Markets Authority said it opened a formal investigation into Google\'s proposals to remove so-called third-party cookies from its popular Chrome browser and Chromium browser engine. Cookies are small pieces of text kept on devices to keep track of user information such as the login name.

But there are also privacy concerns to consider,\" the CMA’s Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said in a statement. Regulators will work with the U.K.\'s privacy commissioner and engage with Google during the investigation, he said. Chrome is the world’s dominant web browser, and many others like Microsoft’s Edge are based on Google\'s Chromium technology. In a market study last year, the CMA found that Google controls more than 90% of the U.K.’s 7.3 billion-pound ($10 billion) search advertising market. Google stressed that it hasn\'t made any changes yet and it\'s collaborating with the industry to come up with the best solution....",

        summary: "Over 200 employees at Google and other of Alphabet units have formed the “Alphabet Workers Union” to better protect members from unfair labor practices, Reuters reported. Unlike traditional labor unions, the “Alphabet Workers Union” is a “minority union” that lacks the influence to force the company into any collective negotiations over wages or other issues, according to the report. Under US labor law, the union\'s demands can be ignored by Alphabet (GOOGL) unless the union has the support of a majority of employees. The Reuters report indicated that union leaders acknowledge that widespread support is unlikely as company perks, free meals and gyms are some of the obstacles that discourage employees from unionizing against their employers.The union will collect 1% of members’ total compensation, which will contribute towards the hiring of support staff who will empower the union to fight against Alphabet more aggressively than in the past, Reuters said. (See GOOGL stock analysis on TipRanks)Robert W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reiterated his Buy rating on Alphabet stock last week and raised his price target from $1,725 to $2,000 (15% upside potential)Sebastian said the that strong e-commerce trends through the holiday shopping season benefitted the company, and digital-advertising visibility in 2021 is improving. He added that an expected recovery in travel, recreation and automotive ads could contribute to a long-term valuation for Alphabet of $3,000 a share.Overall, consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 26 Buys and 2 Holds. The average price target of $1,944.04 suggests upside potential of around 12% over the next 12 months.Related News:Hologic Completes $64M Acquisition of Somatex; Street Sees 24% UpsideParatek Pharma Secures $60M Loan To Repay Hercules CapitalLife Storage Ramps Up Dividend By 3.7%, Plans Stock Split",
